              **Before You Start...**

              This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
              or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

              - Read the [documentation](https://github.com/dungeon-rs/dungeon-rs/blob/master/README.md)
              - Check [existing issues](https://github.com/dungeon-rs/dungeon-rs/issues) for similar problems
              - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dungeon-rs/dungeon-rs/discussions)

              Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
              However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
              you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
