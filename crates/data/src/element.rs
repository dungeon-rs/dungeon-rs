//! Defines the [`Element`] enum and it's implementations.

/// An [`Element`] is the lowest level of the project hierarchy.
///
/// It defines a specific element that can be drawn on the screen, commonly  represented as an asset
/// with additional metadata.
/// For portability reasons we don't store the full path of an asset, we simply store an ID which we
/// can resolve later through the `assets` module.
///
/// We don't have to store *all* information about the elements in the enum; things like translation,
/// scale, rotation, enabled, ... can all be inferred later from the components it's placed alongside.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here's how to spawn a simple `Element` for the Walls.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use data::Project;
/// # use data::Level;
/// # use data::Layer;
/// # use data::Element;
/// # use std::path::PathBuf;
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// #   App::new()
/// #       .add_systems(Startup, spawn_project)
/// #       .run();
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn spawn_project(mut commands: Commands) {
/// #   let output = PathBuf::new();
///     commands.spawn((
///         Project::new(output, "Roadside Inn"),
///         children![(
///             Level::new("Ground Floor"),
///             children![(
///                 Layer::new("Walls", Transform::IDENTITY),
///                 children![
///                     Element::new_object(String::from("<hash-of-resolvable-asset")),
///                 ]
///             )]
///         )]
///     ));
